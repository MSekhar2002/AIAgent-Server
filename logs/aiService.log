For an admin, it can handle tasks like creating team schedules, assigning work locations, tracking absences, managing time-off requests, and even keeping an eye on who’s available for shifts. It’s like having a personal assistant to keep everything organized and running smoothly!\n\nBut since you’re part of Sekhar's Office team, if you’re curious about how admins use it or have specific questions about scheduling, I’d be happy to explain further or help you connect with your admin.
